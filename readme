TXS Hub & Head
==============

Version: 0.2

The hub is the server with various clients. The aim and current functionality is to display a playlist of the recently played artists and custom messages- you control the hub via a client, the separate head for displaying the playlist and recently integrated functionality to pass the artist name through to my friend's computer, who runs visuals, so the artist name is mixed in with the current set.

There is clear commenting on most of the code.


Points of Interest
------------------

* GTK+ client (crappy looking atm)
* Socket communications
	* multiplexing via GIOChannel on cli and head
	* multiplexing via epoll on svr
* mysql interface
* Use of GTK+ WebKitWebView on head
* SQL to XML converter
* fit for requirement XML parser. Does what it needs to do, no more.

I put these POIs here in case anyone is after a quick example of working code in these areas.


Notes
-----

Functioned well at start of night but after first few hours the server started crashing. This should have been fixed.

No reconnection implemented- if a client drops, that's it until the server restarts and all the clients hail again.


Use
---

Server starts and each client hails as they come online which is then added to the hub.

Each client has a hail message that defines what type of client it is; it is placed on a 'wire' in the hub so when the system changes, the server knows if and what to send to each client.


Compiling
---------

make all 
	makes all the bins

make [server,head,cli]
	makes any one of the bins




Changelog
=========
* Fixed a lot of memory leaks which has fixed crashing bug (for now). Need to run it through valgrind!
* Commented source code
