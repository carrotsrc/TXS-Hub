TXS Hub & Head
==============

Version: 0.1

The hub is the server with various clients. The aim and current functionality is to display a playlist of the recently played artists and custom messages- you control the hub via a client, the separate head for displaying the playlist and recently integrated functionality to pass the artist name through to my friend's computer, who runs visuals, so the artist name is mixed in with the current set.

It is not very well commented yet (/at all)


Points of Interest
------------------

* GTK+ client (crappy looking atm)
* multiplexing via GIOChannel on cli and head
* multiplexing via epoll on svr
* mysql interface
* Use of GTK+ WebKitWebView on head
* SQL to XML converter


Notes
-----

Functioned well at start of night but after first few hours the server started crashing (see bug). Need to take a look before next month's event.
^ this should be fixed now

No reconnection implemented- if a client drops, that's it until the server restarts and all the clients hail again.


Bugs
----

The bug should be fixed now. There were a fair few over looked memory leaks. Need to fire it through valgrind at some point


Use
---

Server starts and each client hails as they come online which is then added to the hub.

Each client has a hail message that defines what type of client it is; it is placed on a 'wire' in the hub so when the system changes, the server knows if and what to send to each client.
